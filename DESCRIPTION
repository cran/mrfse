Version: 0.4
Date: 2022-10-28
Description: Three algorithms for estimating a Markov random field structure.Two of them are an exact version and a simulated annealing version of a penalized maximum conditional likelihood method similar to the Bayesian Information Criterion (Frondana, 2016) <doi:10.11606/T.45.2018.tde-02022018-151123>.The third one is a greedy algorithm based on information theory (Bresler, 2015).
